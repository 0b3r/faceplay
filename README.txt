User Instructions:

When the application window opens and you are ready to use the application, press the start button and keep your head in a neutral position.
In the bottom left-hand corner, there should be a text field that tells the calibration percentage.  Please keep head in central position until it is done calibrating and reads "Streaming."
When calibration completes, the user will see a larger red box around the smaller red box around his/her head that shows the limits the user must reach to move the mouse in a given direction.

Emotions Reference:
Smile: Smile (showing teeth tends to work slightly better, but a grin should work as well)
Contempt: Half-smile (bring one corner of your mouth up)
Surprise: Open your mouth as wide as possible

Tilt your head up and down to move the mouse up and down.
Turn your head left and right to move the mouse left and right.

Smile to left click the mouse
Contempt to right-click the mouse
Surprise to lock/unlock the mouse (the program will not take any actions while locked)
